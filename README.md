# Algorithms and Data Structures - Mini Project #1 - Sorting Shakespeare’s complete works 

https://datsoftlyngby.github.io/soft2020spring/resources/d34f80c6-01-miniproject-sorting-shakespeare.pdf

## Results

Executing SortingTests.java that demo's our Triesort, Mergesort, Selectionsort, Heapsort, Insertionsort and Quicksort algorithms, when used to sort Shakespeare’s complete works.

Note that Triesort, SelectionSort, Heapsort and Insertionsort results are for the sorting of a subset of words (20k of 930k), as they are very slow. They are included this way to show that they actually work.
